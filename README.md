## Three Things & Why

The goal of this app is to provide a convenient place for me to compose and
store my daily submissions of the exercise I call "Three Things & Why."

The originator of this exercise is Martin Seligan, University of Pennsylvania
professor. Here's his explanation of it:

> Every night for the next week, set aside ten minutes before you go to sleep.
Write down three things that went well today and why they went well. You may use
a journal or your computer to write about the events, but it is important that
you have a physical record of what you wrote. The three things need not be
earthshaking in importance (“ My husband picked up my favorite ice cream for
dessert on the way home from work today”), but they can be important (“ My
sister just gave birth to a healthy baby boy”).
Next to each positive event, answer the question “Why did this happen?” For
example, if you wrote that your husband picked up ice cream, write “because
my husband is really thoughtful sometimes” or “because I remembered to call him
from work and remind him to stop by the grocery store.” Or if you wrote, “My
sister just gave birth to a healthy baby boy,” you might pick as the cause “God
was looking out for her” or “She did everything right during her pregnancy.”
> Writing about why the positive events in your life happened may seem awkward
at first, but please stick with it for one week. It will get easier. The odds
are that you will be less depressed, happier, and addicted to this exercise six
months from now.
